Bootstrapping for Convenience and Profit
========================================

After using Vagrant (vagrantup.com), I was inspired by the bootstrap
shell scripts and decided it was a good time to automate one of my most
loathed tasks: configuring my account on a new machine.

So I've whipped up something basic right now, which generates a
new public/private key pair, uploads it to github, clones my dotfiles 
repo and runs the makefile. The idea is the you will upload this in
an easy-to-access location so you can run it from anywhere:

    $ bash <(curl -s https://zick.io/setup)

I plan to make this install my favorite utilities depending on the OS,
and automatically change some other settings, like I have done for 
my server setup cheatsheet (gist.github.com/anoxic/5522840), automated.


(On Debian/Ubuntu you'll want to `apt-get install -y make git` first.)

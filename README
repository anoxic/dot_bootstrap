Bootstrapping for Convenience and Profit
========================================

After using Vagrant (vagrantup.com), I was inspired by the bootstrap
shell scripts and decided it was a good time to automate one of my most
loathed tasks: configuring my account on a new machine.

So I've whipped up something basic right now, which generates a
new public/private key pair, uploads it to github, clones my dotfiles 
repo and runs the makefile. The idea is the you will upload this
somewhere easily accessible that you can run from anywhere, like:

    $ curl https://zick.io/setup | bash

I plan to make this install my favorite utilities depending on the OS,
and automatically change some other settings, like I have done for 
my server setup cheatsheet (gist.github.com/anoxic/5522840), automated.
